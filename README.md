# Working with Ensemble Data

This repository contains tutorials illustrating the differences between "ensemble members" - simulations run with identical model physics and external forcing, differing only in their initial conditions.

Contents are as follows:

1. Plotting Multiple Ensemble Members.ipynb: Shows some basic techniques for reading in multiple ensemble members from a single model using the CMIP6 AWS catalog, storing in xarray, and plotting the ensemble mean and ensemble spread on a time series.

2. Plotting Regional Time Series Using Shapefiles.ipynb: Does similar tasks as tutorial 1, but with the capacity for selecting a region of interest using a shape file rather than a simple lat/lon range.

CodeAlong 1. Plotting Multiple Ensemble Members.ipynb: A partially completed version of tutorial 1, designed to facilitate working through code as a group classroom activity.
